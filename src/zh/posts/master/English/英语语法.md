### 英语句子成分

#### 主语

#### 宾语

#### 谓语

> 谓语由简单动词或者动词短语构成，一个英语句子只能有一个谓语动词

1.谓语动词根据是否需要宾语可以分为：
- 及物动词: He kicked the ball. 
- 不及物动词: He turned and walked away

2.谓语动词的三个特征:

- 时态 (Tense)：表示时间和动作方面的动词形式
- 语态 (Voice)：主动和被动语态
- 语气 (Mood)：陈述、祈使和虚拟语气

3.谓语动词之时态

- 时间：现在、过去、将来和过去将来
- 动作：一般、进行、完成和完成进行

| 不定式   | 原形         | 过去式 | 现在分词 | 过去分词 |
| -------- | ------------ | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| to write | write/writes | wrote  | writing  | written  |

英语中的十六种时态:

| 动作时间 | 现在           | 过去           | 将来           | 过去将来           |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| 一般     | 一般现在时     | 一般过去时     | 一般将来时     | 过去将来时         |
| 进行     | 现在进行时     | 过去进行时     | 将来进行时     | 过去将来进行时     |
| 完成     | 现在完成时     | 过去完成时     | 将来完成时     | 过去将来完成时     |
| 完成进行 | 现在完成进行时 | 过去完成进行时 | 将来完成进行时 | 过去将来完成进行时 |

#### 表语 (与系动词连用)

> 虽然系动词本身有词义，但它不能单独用作谓语，后边必须跟表
>
> 语，构成系表结构，来说明主语的状况、性质、特征等情况

He became a professor. 

She looked angry. 

常见的系动词有 be, feel, smell, sound, taste, appear, become, remain, seem, turn, etc

#### 定语

位置: (定语) 名词 (定语)

The book on the desk is very interesting.

We are looking for someone reliable and hardworking.

#### 状语

可以表示时间、地点、原因、目的、结果、程度、条件、

让步、方式和比较.

#### 同位语

跟在某名词后面，用来解释或说明该名词。或者句子后有逗号/

冒号/破折号，且这些符号后是名词/动名词，则这些名词/动名词

作同位语.

### 英语句子类型

分为三类：简单句、并列句、复合句 (主句+从句)

简单句 5 种：

1. 主+谓。

2. 主+系+表。

3. 主+谓+宾。

4. 主+谓+双宾。

5. 主+谓+宾+宾补

> 双宾和宾补的判断方法

I gave her a Teddy Bear. 两个宾语间加一个是,句意不通顺,双宾语

We elected John monitor.两个宾语间加一个是,句意通顺宾+宾补

### 英语从句种类

名词性从句 (相当于名词)：主语、宾语、表语和同位语从句

形容词性从句 (相当于形容词)：定语从句

副词性从句 (相当于副词)：状语从句

#### 名词性从句之主语从句

That two kids survived the plane crash is a miracle.

#### 名词性从句之宾语从句

由 that 引导：

I am afraid (that) the customer may have misunderstood me.

由 wh-类词引导：

He didn’t say when we shall meet again.

#### 名词性从句之表语从句

由 that 引导：

The truth is that we are short of money. 

由 wh-类词引导：

The question is what the company will do to handle the strike.

#### 名词性从句之同位语从句

由 that 引导：它一般放在 fact, news, idea, truth, hope, problem, information, belief, thought, doubt, promise, question 等抽象名词的后面，对前面的名词作进一步的解释, 说明前面名词的具体含义。

The news that we won the match is true. 

由 wh-类词引导：

I have no idea how I can finish the project on time.

#### 定语从句

**与同位语从句的区别**

that 在定语从句中必须充当成分：

The news that you told me yesterday is not true. 

that 在同位语从句中不充当成分：

The news that the leader will visit us is not true.

**定语从句引导词**

that, who/whom, which, whose, when, where, why 

如果先行词被形容词最高级或 first, last, only, few, much, very 等词修饰，thing, something, anything, nothing 等后必用 that。

**介词+关系代词引导的定语从句**

定语从句之前加介词，一般出于以下两种情况：

1. 依照先行词的要求。例：

The age at which young people are allowed to drive any vehicle should be raised to at least 21. 

2. 由于从句中某个词的要求，通常是动词和形容词。

It is a theory to which many economists subscribe.

#### 状语从句

##### 状语从句类型

时间 - After the fruit is harvested, it is sold at the market.

地点 - Wherever there are computers, there is Microsoft software.

原因 - I didn’t call her because I’m shy.

目的 - She took a computer course in order that she could get a better job.

让步 - Although Jim has a Master’s degree, he works as a store clerk. 

方式 - He looks as if he were frightened.

比较 - This book is more interesting than that one.

##### 特殊引导词

1. 时间状特殊引导词：

2. 条件状特殊引导词：

provided/providing；suppose/supposing；as (so) long as

3. 目的状引导词：

adj./adv./V-ed/n. (不加冠词) +as+主+谓；

V+as+主+助动词 (do, may, might, can, could, will…)

例：

Poor as he is, he is very generous. 

Much as I respect him, I cannot agree with him. 

Praised as he was, he was modest. 

Child as he is, he knows common sense. 

Try as you will, you won’t manage it.

##### 状语从句的省略

如果状语从句和主句的主语相同，且状语从句中有 be 动词，则状语从句的主语和 be 动词可一同省略。

这种省略多见于时间状语从句、条件状语从句、让步状语从句、方式状语从句等.

1. 时间状语从句:

Be sure not to lose confidence when confronted with difficulties. 

2. 条件状语从句:

Most animals we commonly observe do in fact age as we do, if given

the chance to live long enough. 

3. 让步状语从句:

Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes. 

4. 方式状语从句:

### 非谓语

| 分类  | 作名词(主/宾) | 作形容词(定/表/补) | 作副词(状) |
| :---: | :-----------: | :----------------: | :--------: |
| to do |       √       |         √          |     √      |
| doing |       √       |         √          |     √      |
| done  |               |         √          |     √      |

To be or not to be --that is the question. 不定式 (主语)

Seeing is believing. 动名词 (主语+表语)

He came running into the room. 现在分词 (状语)

The prisoner came in, followed by a guard. 过去分词 (状语)

I have something to do. 不定式 (定语)

I find my roommate watching a soccer game. 现在分词 (补语)

后接 sb. (sth.) do/adj./v-ing/v-ed 的动词：

1. 感官动词：see, hear, watch, notice, find 等。

2. 使役动词：let, make, have 等。

注意：若以上结构转为被动语态，则必须加 to。

Her innocence made me feel guilty. 

变为：I was made ________guilty by her innocence.

### 虚拟语气

虚拟语气主要用来表示假设、而非客观存在的事实，所陈述的是

一个条件，不一定是事实，甚至完全与事实相反。虚拟语气通过

谓语动词的特殊形式来表示。

英语中的语气分为陈述语气、祈使语气、虚拟语气、疑问语气和

感叹语气五类。虚拟语气表示说话者做出的假设而非事实，或难

以实现的情况，甚至表达彻底相反的概念。此外如需表达主观愿

望或某种强烈的感情时，也可用虚拟语气。

### 倒装

由于语法结构的要求，或是由于修辞的需要，往往要改变句子的

自然语序，把一些本应置于主语之后的句子成分提到主语之前。

我们称这种语序的变化为 “倒装语序”。这样的倒装语序可能使句

子的内在含义产生细微的、甚至明显的改变。只有注意观察引起

倒装的原因，才能更准确地理解句子的含义。

主语和谓语是句子的核心，它们之间有两种语序：

一是主语在谓语之前称为自然语序 (Natural Order)；

二是主语在谓语之后则称为倒装语序 (Inverted Order)。

而倒装语序中又有完全倒装 (Full Inversion) 和部分倒装 (Partial

Inversion)

### 独立主格 

1. 名词+现分/过分/形/副/介短/不定式。

2. with+名词+现分/过分/形/副/介短/不定式。

1). Weather permitting, we are going to visit you. 

2). The Shenzhou-XI Spaceship launched successfully, the whole

country was in tremendous excitement.

### 名词单复数

1. 物质名词属于不可数名词，没有复数形式。

bread, chalk, coal, water, ice, milk, sand, cheese, tea, sugar…

可用 a+量词+of+物质名词表示一定的数量：

a piece of bread

a glass of water

a grain of sand

2. 许多抽象名词属于不可数名词

information, advice, luck, laughter, anger…

可用 a+量词+of+抽象名词表示一定的数量：

a piece of information

a fit of anger

### 主谓一致

谓语就近原则：

Not only A but also B…

Not only A but B…

Not only A but B…as well. 

Either A or B…

Neither A nor B…

谓语就远原则：

A as well as B…

A along with B…

A together with B…

A coupled with B…

A including B…

A in addition to B…

## 英语核心语法：时态、语态、虚拟语气

### 时态

#### 一般体

1.一般体中的一般现在时、一般过去时分别表示现在、过去

的经常性、习惯性动作或状态

We have meals three times a day． (现在的习惯)

He is always ready to help others． (现在的状态)

When I was a boy, I often went to play in that park. (过去的习惯)

2.一般现在时还可表示客观真理、科学事实

The teacher taught us that the sun rises in the east.

3.一般现在时还可用在 if，unless，even if 引导的条件状语从句中，由 when，before，until (till)，as soon as，the moment，once引导的时间状语从句中，由 no matter what/ who/ which/ when/where/ how 或 whatever，whoever，whichever，whenever，wherever，however 引导的让步状语从句中，这时主句往往表将来 (出现will/ shall/ can/ must) 或主句是祈使句。即主将从现

I’ll go with you as soon as I finish my work．

4.一般将来时的用法

- 现在看来以后要发生的动作或存在的状态；事物的固有属性或必然趋势。 Fish will die without water．
- be going to+动词原形” 表示 “计划、打算要做某事”，此外，be going to 还可表示根据现在的迹象，对未来进行推断。
- be about to+动词原形” 表示 “立即的将来”，因此，该句型很少与表示将来的具体时间状语连用，但可以和 when 引导的状语从句连用。
- be to+动词原形,表示 “按计划或安排要做的事”。

#### 进行体

1.一个长动作作为背景，被一个短动作打断，长动作往往用进行体，短动作用一般体。

My brother fell while he was riding his bicycle and hurt himself．

2.表示计划、安排要做的事.

I am taking my Mum

3.表示反复出现的或习惯性的动作，往往含有赞赏、厌恶、遗憾等情绪，常与 always, continually, constantly 等连用.

He is always thinking of others first．

#### 完成体

1.现在完成时

- 一个动作开始于过去，持续到现在 (也许还将持续下去)。

  表示从过去延续到现在并包括现在在内的一段时间的状语有Lately, recently, in the last/past few days/years, since then, up to now，so far 等

  In the past few years, great changes have taken place in my hometown.

- This/It is the first/second…time + that 从句。that 从句的谓语要用现在完成时

  This is the first time (that) I have come here．

- 在条件、时间、让步状语从句中，表示将来某时间以前已完成的动作。

  I will not believe you unless I have seen it with my own eyes．

- 瞬间动词又叫非延续性动词、终止性动词。瞬间动词可以用于完成时态，但不可以接表示一段时间的状语，若要接表示一段时间的状语，需要做一些相应的变换。

  (×) He has come to Beijing since last year. 

  (√) He has lived in Beijing since last year

  常见的瞬间动词有：come, go, get to/reach/arrive at/in, leave, buy, sell, open, close, get up, join/take part in, begin/start, return/ give, borrow/lend, become/turn, bring/take, die, finish/end, receive/hear from, marry, break, lose, jump 等

- Hardly/Scarcely/Rarely had…done…when…；No sooner had…done…than…；when 和 than 从句里用一般过去时，主句用过去完成时，且用倒装，表示 “刚刚……就……”。

- That/It/This was the first/second time +that 从句。that 从句的谓语要用过去完成时。

  It was the third time (that) he had made the same mistake．

#### 易混时态

1.一般过去时和现在完成时的用法区别

一般过去时所表示的一个或一段过去时间是可以具体确定的，与其他时间没有牵连，它所表示的事情纯属过去，现在完成时说的是现在的情况。

2.一般过去时和过去完成时的用法区别

- .一般过去时是指过去的动作或情况，而过去完成时指过去的一个动作或时间之前发生的事
- 过去完成时的时间状语常用 by 和 before 引导的短语表示

3.过去完成时与现在完成时的用法区别

- 两种时态都常与表示一段时间的状语连用，但现在完成时表示的是延续到现在或同现在有关的动作 (句中不可有表示过去特定时间的状语)，而过去完成时表示的是在过去某时之前已经完成或延续到过去某时的动作 (句中有表示过去特定时间的状语)。

### 语态

#### 被动语态

1.被动语态的构成

英语中的及物动词一般都有主动语态和被动语态两种形式。被动语态由 “助动词 be+过去分词” 构成。助动词 be 随着主语的人称、数、时态和语气的不同而变化。

2.被动语态的用法

- 不知道谁是动作的执行者，或没有必要指明动作的执行者。

  No. I hadn’t been invited. Did they have a big wedding?

- 需要强调或突出动作的承受者或事件本身。

  All the employees except the manager are encouraged to work online at home．

- 在文章标题、广告、新闻中。 Girls wanted．

> 注意短语动词的被动语态

That old man was often laughed at．

Bad habits have been done away with.

#### 主动形式表被动意义

1."系动词 look, sound, feel, smell, taste, appear, seem, go, prove, turn, stay, become, fall, get, grow, remain, keep+形容词/名词"构成系表结构。

The steel feels cold．

2.表示开始、结束、运动的动词, 如 begin, finish, start, open, close, stop, end, shut, run, move 等。

Work began at 7 o’clock this morning.

### 虚拟语气

#### 用于状语从句中 

| 假设           | 虚拟条件句                                                   | 主句                                            | 例句                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 与现在事实相反 | If +主语+动词的过去式(be 动词用were)                         | 主语+ should/would /could/might + 动词原形      | If I were you, I should seize the chance to go abroad        |
| 与过去事实相反 | If +主语+had+过去分词                                        | 主语+ should/would /could/might +have +过去分词 | If you had taken my advice, you would not have failed in the exams |
| 与将来事实相反 | If +主语+动词的过去式<br />If +主语+were to +动词原形<br />If+主语+should+动词原形 | 主语+ should/would /could/might + 动词原形      | If he should not come tomorrow, we should put off the meeting till next Monday |

#### 用于主语从句中

It is necessary/important/crucial/critical that sb./sth. + (should) do…

例：

It is necessary that you (should) put on a suit to attend her wedding. 

It is important that he submit his plan before the deadline.

#### 用于宾语从句中 

表命令、建议和要求的动词一般要接虚拟语气, 即 V+sb (should) do,常用动词：advise, agree, demand, insist, command, decide, ensure, order, instruct, propose, recommend, require, request, suggest, urge等。

> 注：当 suggest 表示 “暗示，表明” 之意，suggest 后的宾语从句不使用虚拟语气，应使用陈述语气

The smile on his face suggested that he was satisfied with our work．

#### 用于表语从句和同位语从句中

在 suggestion, proposal, order, plan, idea, request, advice等名词后的表语从句和同位语从句中用虚拟语气，其构成是 “should+动词原形”，should 可以省略

My idea is that we (should) think it over before accepting it．

We all agreed to his suggestion that she (should) deserve a reward.

#### 特殊结构

It is (about/high) time sb./sth. did sth. 

would rather (would as soon, would sooner) sb. did sth.

#### 虚拟语气中 if 状语从句的倒装

如果虚拟语气的 if 状语从句中有助动词 had、were 或情态动词should、could、might 等，则可以去掉 if，将 had、were 或 should等置于句首进行倒装。

If he had not been promoted, he would never have remained with the company.

Had  he not been promoted, he would never have remained with the company.

## 名词从句及例句解析

从句分为以下三类：名词从句、定语从句、状语从句。其中，名词从句分为以下四种：**主语从句、宾语从句、表语从句、同位语从句**.(主宾表同)

> 注：名词从句的谓语动词用**第三人称单数**。如果主语从句较长，经常用 it 作形式主语，而将真正的主语从句置于句末，尤以 that-从句最为常见；如果主语从句较长，但仍保持原状，没有用 it 作形式主语，则是为了突出强调

#### 主语从句

How well the predictions will be validated by later performances <u>depends upon</u> (the amount, reliability, and appropriateness of the information used) <u>and on</u> (the skill and wisdom with which it is interpreted).

这些预测多大程度上为后来的表现所证实，要取决于所采用信息的数量、可靠性和适应性，以及解释这些信息的方法和智慧

It <u>does not help</u> that building a big, powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people (striving to assert themselves)

建造大坝已经成为想试图证明自己的国家和民众所取得的成就的一个象征，然而这并没有什么好处

#### 宾语从句

Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports (in her new book *Divorce Talk*) that most of the women (she interviewed) —but only a few of the men—gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces.

社会学家 Catherine Kohler Riessman 在其新书《漫谈离婚》中讲到，她采访过的大多数女性把夫妻之间缺乏交流作为其离婚的原因，而只有少部分男士承认这一点。

They found that (after a surprise departure), the probability (that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings) increased by nearly 20%

他们发现，董事们突然离职后，公司随后重新公布收益的几率几乎增加了 20%

#### 表语从句

One of the apparent paradoxes of modern food is that (while the amount of time spent in cooking meals has fallen from 60 minutes a day in 1980 to 13 minutes a day in 2002), the number of books and television programs on cooking has multiplied

现代饮食中一个显而易见的悖论是，尽管人们花在烹饪上的时间从 1980 年每天的 60 分钟下降到 2002 年每天的 13 分钟，有关烹饪的书籍和电视节目却在迅速增加。

#### 同位语从句

This episode crystallizes the irony that (although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations), they often talk less at home.

这个小插曲揭示了一个具有讽刺意味的事实，那就是尽管美国的男士在公共场合比女性健谈，但在家里他们却往往很少说话。

#### 例句翻译:

1. (主语从句) That the seas are being overfished has been known for years.

    海洋正在被人们过度捕捞，多年以来这已是人尽皆知的了。

2. (宾语从句) You have all heard it repeated that men of science work by means of induction and deduction. 

   你们都多次听说过，科学家是用归纳法和演绎法工作的。

3. (表语从句) Women are much too preoccupied by family. Once the marriage begins to disintegrate, they’re lost. That’s where their unhappiness springs from and that’s why most divorced mothers regard themselves as victims. 

   妇女太专注于家庭了。一旦婚姻开始瓦解，她们就失去了方向。这就是不幸福的来源，也是为什么大多数离婚妇女都认为自己是受害者的原因。

4. (同位语从句) A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears.

   一个世纪前，弗洛伊德阐述了他具有革命性的理论，即梦是对我们内心深处不曾意识到的欲望与恐惧的反映。

## 定语从句及例句解析

定语从句即在句中用一个具有主谓/主谓宾/主系表结构的完整的句子来充当定语，修饰前面的名词 (短语) 或代词，这种名词 (短语) 或代词称为先行词。

#### 定语从句常见引导词

that, who, which, where, when, why

#### 定语从句可分为限定性和非限定性

限定性定语从句的关系词和先行词之间不用逗号隔开，而非限定性定语从句则用逗号隔开，不能以 that 引导。

1) She despised people. 

2) She despised people who flattered her.

定语从句 “who flattered her” 起到了限制名词的作用 (缩小了名词的表示范围)，因此称其为限定性定语从句。

1) I made a card for mom who loves me most. (×)

2) I made a card for mom, who loves me most. (√)

某些场景下，先行词的内涵已经是唯一，这时就无法再缩小这个词的表示范围，其后只能使用非限定性定语从句。 

####  “介词+关系代词” 引导的定语从句：

定语从句之前加介词，主要出于以下两种情况：

1. 依照先行词的要求 (往前看) ;

2. 由于定从中某个词的要求，通常是动词或形容词 (介词与其构成搭配) (往后看)

Many consumers seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, (which investors now view as a necessary ingredient to a sustained boom).

许多消费者似乎已经受到股票市场波动的影响，但现在投资者把这种波动看成是经济持续增长的必要因素。

All of these forces appear to signify a future (in which the language of advertising, popular culture, and consumer products become similar). 

所有这些力量似乎代表着一个广告语言、流行文化和消费产品逐渐趋同的未来。

The speed and effectiveness (with which these steps are taken) are closely related to the history of management, *the art of getting* *things done*). 

这些步骤实施的速度和有效性与管理的历史密切相关，而管理是一门做事的艺术。

On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies—(to which heavy industry has shifted)—have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed. 

另一方面，新兴的石油进口国—重工业已经转移到这些国家—能源密集程度变得更高，从而可能面临更大的压力

Freedom and dignity are the possessions of the autonomous man, and they’re essential to practices (in which a person is held responsible for his conduct and given credit for his achievements)

自由和尊严是独立自主的人所拥有的，而且对于认定一个人对自己的行为负责并因其成就而得到认可是必不可少的

Because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should actively recruit *(to its cause)* not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Cooper, (who has made courageous statements about the value of animal research), but all (who receive medical treatment) 

因为与此利益关系最紧密的是病人，医疗研究机构不仅应该积极争取像史蒂芬·库珀这样的名人来支持自己的事业—他曾勇敢地陈述了动物研究的价值，而且还要争取所有接受医疗的人的支持。

This, for those *(as yet unaware of such a disadvantage),* refers to discrimination against those (whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet). 

对于那些到目前还未意识到这种不利的人来说，它指的是对姓氏首字母位于字母表后半部分的人的歧视。

## 状语从句及例句解析

状语从句是在句中作状语成分的句子。状语从句可以修饰谓语或整个句子。状语从句的位置灵活，可放在句首、句中或句末，位于句首时常用逗号隔开，如从句较短且与主句关系密切时，可不用逗号。

状语从句分为：时间状语从句、地点状语从句、原因状语从句、条件状语从句、结果状语从句、让步状语从句、目的状语从句、方式状语从句、比较状语从句。

<u>When Thomas Keller, (one of America’s foremost chefs), announced (that on Sept.1 he would abolish the practice of tipping at Per Se, and replaces it with European-style service charge),</u> I knew three groups would be opposed: customers, servers and restaurant owners.

## 倒装结构

英文句子有两种语序，一种是自然语序，另一种就是倒装语序。从形式上看，倒装分为两种：完全倒装和部分倒装。谓语动词全部位于主语前面的称作完全倒装，这里的谓语动词必须是运动性/存在性不及物动词 (用 vi.表示)；只将谓语的一部分 (通常是助动词或情态动词) 位于主语前面的称作部分倒装，这里的谓语是及物动词 (用 vt.表示)。**倒装的主要作用是表示突出强调或句子平衡**。但是不论哪种倒装，都必须要在最前面加上某些必要成分才能成为完整意义上的倒装

完全倒装：

必要成分+vi.+主语+其它成分。

部分倒装：

必要成分+助动词/情态动词+主语+vt.+其它成分。

#### **完全倒装**

置于句首的必要成分：

1. 表示地点或方位的副词, 如 here, there 等;

2. 表示地点或方位的介词短语, 如 into the bush, under the bridge, 等。

> 注：完全倒装的句子里的谓语动词通常为运动性或存在性的不及物动词。

- There stood a young lady. (stand 为存在性不及物动词)

=>  A young lady stood there. (自然语序)

- Into the bush jumped the small rabbit. (jump 为运动性不及物动词)

=> The small rabbit jumped into the bush. (自然语序)

- There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers.

=> A social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers exists there.

记者们和其读者之间存在着社会和文化隔阂。



#### 部分倒装

置于句首的必要成分：

1. 否定性副词或词组, 如：

   a) not, nor, never, seldom, little, hardly, scarcely (不/几乎不) ;

   b) by no means, not in the least, on no account, in no way, in no case, under no circumstances, under no condition (绝不) ;

   c) no sooner…than…, hardly/scarcely…when… (一……就……) ;not until… (直到……才……) ;

   d) not only…but (also) …. (不仅……而且……) ;

2. only+状语 (从句)

   Only by diligence can you succeed.

3. 程度副词 so

   So deeply did he miss the girl that he couldn’t eat and sleep.

- Not until near the end of the nineteenth century did inventors achieve the delicate balance of insulation and circulation needed for an efficient ice-box.

=> science and technology advances so fast that a great many things inconceivable in the past have become commonplace.

科技进步如此迅速，以致于许多在过去是不可思议的事情现在已经变得很平常了

#### 特殊倒装

在英语中，有时为了强调，通常将谓语部分的现在分词、过去分词、形容词或不定式置于句首，从而构成特殊倒装。例：

Standing beside the table was his student. 

自然语序：His student was standing beside the table.

- Closely associated with the value they place on individualism is the importance Americans assign to privacy. 

=>  The importance Americans assign to privacy is closely associated with the value they place on individualism

与重视个人主义密切相关的是美国人对隐私的重视

- The inner workings of our own brains we feel to be uniquely worthy of investigation.

=> We feel the inner workings of our own brains to be uniquely worthy of investigation.

我们觉得，只有大脑内部的运动情况才是唯一值得研究的内容。

## 非谓语结构

英语中单个的动词 (以 v.表示) 只能充当谓语，那么如果想让 v. 充当主语、宾语、表语、同位语、状语、补语、独立成分等，则需要改变 v. 的形式。具体方法有四种：把 v.变为不定式 (to v.)、现在分词 (v.-ing)、动名词 (v.-ing) 和过去分词 (v.-ed)，这就是**非谓语结构**。

#### 一般规律

①非谓语作定语时通常置于名词之后，即: n.+ to do/doing/done；

②非谓语作状语时通常的形式是:to do/doing/done，句子；或：句子，to do/doing/done.

## 强调结构

**“强调”** 是一种语言表达形式，意在 “突出” 和 “着重” 的作用。强调结构最常用的模式是：It is/was…that/ who/ which…即把被强调的部分放在 It is/was 和 that 之间，强调人时可用 who代替 that。

按照原理，除了谓语动词之外，一个句子的其它成分都可以用此结构进行强调，但最常见的被强调的成分是主语、宾语、表语和状语四大类型。强调结构译成中文时一般可套用 “正是/只是……(才) ……” 句式。

> 注 ： 若 对 一 个 句 子 的 谓 语 动 词 进 行 强 调 , 在 该 动 词 前 加do/does/did 即可。

例：I love monkeys. → I do love monkeys.

强调句识别技巧：

1) 如果一个句子以 It is/was 开头，则可能是两种句式之一：强调句或形式主语句。

2) 如果将 It is/was…that 去掉，句子仍然正确，则该句是强调句。

3) 区分 It is/was 非形容词 that: 强调句 vs. It is/was 形容词that: 形式主语句。

## 省略结构

莎士比亚曾言: Brevity is the soul of wit. (言以简洁为贵)。英文句子中的某些成分因上下文已提供了充分明确的信息而不必出现，或前面已出现的某些成分，为了避免不必要的重复，可以不再出现，且不至于引起误解或歧义，这种语言现象叫做**省略**。

在并列句中，后面的分句往往省略和上文相同的部分，以避免重复。

#### 状语从句中省略

在状语从句中，最常见的省略方式是：如果状语从句的主语和主句的主语相同，同时从句的谓语中含有系动词 be, 则可将从句的主语和 be 动词省略。这种省略现象在时间状语从句、条件状语从句、让步状语从句、方式状语从句等中最常见。
